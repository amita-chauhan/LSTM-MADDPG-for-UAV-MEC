# LSTM-MADDPG-for-UAV-MEC


This repository contains the implementation of a hybrid **LSTM + Multi-Agent DDPG** model for intelligent **computation offloading** in **UAV-Enabled Mobile Edge Computing (MEC)** environments. The goal is to optimize offloading decisions by considering dynamic environments and user mobility.

## ðŸ§  Key Features

- **LSTM** for temporal modeling of UAV movements, task demands, or channel conditions.
- **Multi-Agent DDPG (MADDPG)** to support decentralized decision-making across multiple UAVs and users.
- **Computation Offloading Optimization**: Maximize energy efficiency, minimize task latency, and ensure QoS.
- **Support for Dynamic Environments** including time-varying wireless channels and task arrivals.
